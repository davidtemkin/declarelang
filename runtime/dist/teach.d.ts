 *  A near-miss on a HINTED name answers with the hint, not the spelling:
 *  `colour` is one edit from `color`, and what that reader needs is
 *  "text color is 'textColor'", not "did you mean 'color'?" — which names an
 *  attribute that does not exist either. The tables know intent; reaching them
 *  through a typo is worth more than reaching a nearby letter-string.
 *  …but only for a name long enough for the miss to mean something. Routing to
 *  a hint asserts what the author was THINKING, which is a longer reach than
 *  naming a spelling, so it wants more evidence than a short string can carry:
 *  `zap` is one edit from `gap` and is a typo for nothing at all. Five is the
 *  same floor nearestName already uses to widen its own budget. */
